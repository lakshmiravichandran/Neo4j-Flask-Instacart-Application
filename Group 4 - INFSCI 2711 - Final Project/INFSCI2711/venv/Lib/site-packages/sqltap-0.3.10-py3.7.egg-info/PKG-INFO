Description: 
        sqltap is a library that allows you to profile and introspect the
        queries that your application makes using SQLAlchemy.
        
        sqltap helps you quickly understand:
        
           * how many times a sql query is executed
           * how much time your sql queries take
           * where your application is issuing sql queries from
